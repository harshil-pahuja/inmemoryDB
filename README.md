# Write-up
To make this an official assignment, I think there is a lot of room for improvement in the instructions document. There needs to be more step by step guidance for students to get started in terms of what data strutures to use, and explaining what needs to happen in each function. Given that I had not used Java in a long time, it was really hard for me to think conceptually without using external resources, which is why I think the instructions document should also contain Java code samples to make it easier for students to understand how the functions are supposed to work. Additionally, a sample output page would be useful to students to compare their outputs. If students are allowed to have the option to choose their own language, there should be more resources posted for implementing an in-memory database with other languages like Python or C++, or not give students the option at all if there aren't those kinds of resources.
